## 🚀 **About Me**  
Analytical Storyteller | BBA Strategist | Data Alchemist
As a BBA candidate and future-focused analyst, I transform raw data into actionable business strategies through SQL, Python, and cloud-driven analytics (Azure). My expertise in Power BI and Tableau allows me to craft visually compelling narratives that demystify complex datasets, turning ambiguity into clarity for cross-functional teams.

I thrive at the intersection of numbers and nuance, where spreadsheets meet strategy. Whether optimizing supply chains via predictive modeling or automating workflows with Python, I bridge technical rigor with business outcomes.

**🔑 Core Belief: “Data whispers secrets; analysts translate them into scalable solutions.”*
